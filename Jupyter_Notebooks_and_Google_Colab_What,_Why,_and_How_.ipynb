        "Jupyter Notebooks are an open-source interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They are particularly popular among data scientists and researchers for conducting data analysis, machine learning tasks, and statistical modeling, largely because of their flexibility in combining executable code with rich text elements in a single document. The name \"Jupyter\" is derived from the core supported programming languages: Julia, Python, and R, though the platform has since grown to support many other languages.\n",

        "Jupyter Notebooks offer an ideal environment for teaching introductory data analysis because they seamlessly integrate explanatory text with live, executable code. This integration fosters a hands-on learning approach, enabling COOPers to immediately apply theoretical concepts in an interactive manner. The visual feedback from executed code aids comprehension, allowing us to interweave theory and practice. Additionally, Jupyter Notebooks support rich media, such as plots and graphs, which are essential for data visualization, as well as photos and videos for enriching the course content. Their easy-to-share format also promotes collaboration, ensuring COOPers can review, replicate, and continually practice with these concepts on their own time, enhancing the overall learning experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jupyter Notebooks are also ubiquitous in the industry and its adoption in data analytics workflows will only continue to grow in the future. By getting exposure now, we will enable COOPers to have a better understanding of this common industry tool."

If you are trying to open a Colab notebook that is stored in Google Drive, you will need to ensure that you have the `Colaboratory` application installed for your Google Account. It is often available by default, but if it isn’t, it can be activated by going to the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/colaboratory/1014160490159), searching for “Colaboratory” and installing it.

The class descriptions and links to each of the classes in our curriculum can be [found here](https://freestackinitiative.github.io/COOP-PythonLessons/). Next to each class in the provided class list is an `Open in Colab` button that will take COOPers directly to the notebook in their browser. From there, they can go ahead and start working on the content - no configuration or further setup is required. And when they are done working through the content, they must save a copy of the notebook that they edited in order to keep their changes. By default, they are served a copy of the original file. This prevents them from unintentionally saving over and modifying the actual course content, which was another pain point we identified in the initial rollout of the new content."
